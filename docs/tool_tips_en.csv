Max Height,The maximum allowable component height for components within this keepout region. If zero then no components are allowed

Combine Parameters By,The following filter parameters are combined using OR or AND
Side Less Than,Filtered or Deleted if a component's side length is less than this value - ignored if zero
Height Less Than,Filtered or Deleted if a component's height side length is less than this value - ignored if zero
Power Less Than,Filtered or Deleted if a component's power dissipation  is less than this value - ignored if zero
Power Density Less Than,Filtered or Deleted if a component's power dissipation per unit area is less than this value - ignored if zero
Name Contains,Filtered or Deleted if the component's Reference Designator contaions this string, e.g U. Do not use U*

Component Type,Simple - Little or no package information is known apart from physical size.|2R if the thermal resistance between junction and board and junction and case are known
Component Material,If the component type is Simple then this material will give an approximate indication of the predominant construction material.
Filtered,If True then the component's power will be smeared over the entire board surface. This is appropriate for small components and results in quicker thermal solution times.
Deactivated,If True then the component is removed from view and takes no part in the solution.
